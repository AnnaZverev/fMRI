# fMRI
Accurate anomaly detection in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is crucial for diagnosing neurological disorders, yet is limited by the scarcity of labeled pathological datasets and a predominant focus on static spatial analyses. Addressing these limitations, we propose a transformer-based anomaly detection framework leveraging synthetic data generated via structured brain masks to ensure anatomical plausibility and temporal coherence. We synthetically inserted four clinically relevant anomaly types into fMRI sequences: hyperintensity, hypointensity, scattered focal disruptions, and ischemia-like anomalies. We trained a hybrid architecture - combining Vision Transformers (ViT) for spatial feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal analysis - on this enriched dataset. Experimental validation demonstrated strong model performance, achieving an accuracy of 96.44\% and ROC AUC of 99.30\%, with robust generalization to unseen real and synthetic datasets. Our structured synthetic anomaly generation method offers a scalable solution to the shortage of pathological data, significantly enhancing fMRI-based anomaly detection and presenting potential for clinical decision support in neuroimaging diagnostics.
